# Airfare-Predictor
Airfare Predictor using ARIMA Time series forecasting

ARIMA forecasting algorithm is implemented using Pandas, Sklearn libraries in Python and the Algorithm is implemented on a PHP interface.

The tuning.py python code helps in tuning the parameters required for the ARIMA algorithm based on the dataset values. 
These parameters are passed to the predictor.py python code to fit and predict the Airfare for the next year on a monthly basis.

The predicted values are projected using matplotlib.
